Hi! I’m David Akero, an aspiring aerospace engineer documenting my journey of exploration, learning, and creation. This portfolio isn’t just about the projects I complete—it’s about the process, the challenges, and the discoveries along the way.

Here, you’ll follow me as I:

Design and model in CAD — building parts, assemblies, and simulations in Fusion 360.

Learn and apply coding skills — using Python to analyze data, visualize results, and solve problems.

Experiment with engineering concepts — testing mechanics, electronics, and creative design solutions.

Take on aerospace-inspired projects — applying my learning to challenges in aviation and space systems.

Each post, project, and update is a snapshot of my learning journey, showing how I grow, iterate, and improve over time. This portfolio reflects curiosity, persistence, and a love of problem-solving, and it’s meant to inspire others while charting my path toward becoming an aerospace engineer.

Follow along to see the journey unfold!
