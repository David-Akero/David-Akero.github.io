## Introduction
This week I took my first steps as a beginner in CAD design and Python programming. I focused on short, hands-on projects in **Fusion 360** and on writing small Python scripts to reinforce core concepts. These early projects are being collected in my engineering portfolio as I work toward a future in **aerospace engineering**.

## Fusion 360 progress (what I learned)
**Hours spent:** ~12 hrs  
**Models completed:** 5 (LEGO block, glass bottle, complex lofted bottle, paper clip, ice tray)

**Core skills practiced:**
- 2D sketches, constraints, and construction lines  
- Extrude, revolve, hollowing, and cutting material out  
- Loft, sweep, fit-point splines, and guide rails  
- Rectangular patterns and tangent arcs  
- Offset and midplane construction planes; intersecting geometry  
- Filleting and applying appearances

**Notes / highlights:**
- Lofting and guide rails were the most challenging but helped me form smooth, organic shapes (e.g., complex bottle).  
- Using reference imaging was useful when modelling the glass bottle.

## Python progress (what I learned)
**Hours spent:** ~8 hrs  
**Small scripts created:** 7

**Concepts practiced:**
- Syntax basics: input/output, type conversion  
- Data structures: lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries  
- Built-in functions: `max()`, `min()`, `count()`  
- Set operations: union, intersection, difference

**Example scripts (short snippets):**

Age calculator
```python
# Age Calculator
birth_year = int(input("Enter your birth year: "))
age = 2025 - birth_year
print("You are", age, "years old!")
