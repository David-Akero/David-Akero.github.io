excerpt: "Week 1: Hands-on Fusion 360 practice and Python fundamentals — modeling 5 parts and writing 7 small scripts to start my aerospace engineering portfolio."
---

## Introduction
This week I took my first steps as a beginner in CAD design and Python programming. I completed a series of Fusion 360 beginner projects—including simple parts and lofted bottles—to practice sketches, extrusions, sweeps, lofts, and construction planes. At the same time I worked through Python basics and core data structures, building small scripts (an age calculator, distance converter, and list/ set/dictionary experiments). These projects form the start of my engineering portfolio and document my learning journey toward aerospace engineering.

## Fusion 360 — skills & deliverables
**Time invested:** ~3 hours  
**Models completed (5):** LEGO block, glass bottle, complex lofted bottle, paper clip, ice tray

**Core skills practiced**
- 2D sketching with constraints and construction lines  
- Extrude, revolve, hollowing, and material removal operations  
- Loft and sweep operations, fit-point splines, and guide rails for organic shapes  
- Rectangular patterns, tangent arcs, and fillets  
- Creating offset and midplane construction planes; handling intersecting geometry  
- Applying appearances and preparing renders for documentation
- Creating threading patterns

**Outcomes & evidence**
- Completed 5 CAD models with exported renders and source files. [CAD Project Summary - Week 1](/projects/fusion360/week1/)
- Improved ability to convert reference images into accurate 3D geometry (glass bottle).  
- Lofting and guide-rail workflows enabled smoother complex shapes (useful for aerodynamic surfaces and housings).

## Python — skills & deliverables
**Time invested:** ~2 hours  
**Scripts created:** 7 small programs (utility & practice scripts)

**Concepts practiced**
- Basic syntax: input/output, type conversion, functions  
- Data structures: lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries  
- Built-in operations: `max()`, `min()`, `count()`  
- Set operations: union, intersection, difference

**Example**

Age calculator
```python
# Age Calculator
birth_year = int(input("Enter your birth year: "))
age = 2025 - birth_year
print("You are", age, "years old!")
```

## Reflection
The biggest challenge this week has been learning how to keep track of the various feautures available in both python and CAD softwares. I have come to leanr that each feautur eplays a crucial part in bringing to life ideas in the most feasible and accurate way. Through practice, I aim to integrate these skills early, developing a solid base as my journey grows more complex. I am starting to  see how these two areas come together, both requiring problem solving, creativity, and attential to detail--essential characterstics for an aspiring engineer.

Next week I plan to continue building foundational skills through practical python and CAD project, and make a shift to more niched uses of each skill in aerospace engineering, particularly the visualization of data through python. As I continue this journey, I aim to keep learning engineeirng skills step by step, and build an inspiration student engineering portifolio.
