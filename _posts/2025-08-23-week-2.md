## Introduction
This week, although slow, was still an essential step in my journey to further preparing myself for an Aerospace Engineering career. I continued my learning through the basic features of Fusion360, further understanding how each can be applied to both simple and complex shapes. Furthermore, I continued to learning basic but essential operations and expressions in Python, enabling me to manipulate various numerical and textual data. I look forward to continuing in my practuce of these skills, and further applying them to various aerospace-related challenges.

## Fusion 360 — skills & deliverables
**Time invested:** ~3 hours  
**Models completed (3):** Hex Nut, Bike Grip, Door Stop

**Core skills practiced**
- **Polygon & Mirror Sketching** – using polygon tools and symmetry to build precise, balanced sketches.  
- **Hole Features & Chamfers (Standard + Custom)** – creating accurate holes and applying chamfers both with the chamfer tool and by revolving custom sketches.  
- **Parametric Edits & Error Handling** – adjusting dimensions through parameters, editing past features in the timeline, and fixing minor model errors.  
- **Text, Emboss & Deboss** – adding text to models and raising/recessing it onto surfaces for labels or decorative features.  
- **Combining Bodies & Applying Appearances** – merging multiple bodies into single parts and assigning materials/finishes to specific regions.  
- **Fillet Variations (Complex, Offset, Multiple)** – projecting fillets onto complex geometry, offsetting faces for adjustments, and layering multiple fillets for refined edges.  
- **Organized Workflow** – breaking designs into clear parts, naming sketches/bodies, and managing the parametric timeline for efficient revisions.  



**Outcomes & evidence**
- Created 3 complex models with exported renders and source files.
- Learned various new features and their applicatiosn to various designs.
- Improved utilization of the parametric design feautures of Fusion360 ensuring success in each design.
- Built a comprehensive understanding of how to maintain accuracy, organization, and realism in designs

## Python — skills & deliverables
**Time invested:** ~1 hours  
**Scripts created:** 5 small programs (practice scripts)

**Concepts practiced**
- Arithmetic and Conditional Operators – Learned to perform calculations and make decisions by comparing values.
- String Operators – Learned to join, repeat, or manipulate text values in Python.

**Example**
```python
##greater, less than, or equal to 10
numInput = int(input("#10 Comparison - Enter your number: "))

isGreater = numInput > 10
isLess = numInput < 10
isEqual = numInput == 10  

print("Is your number greater than 10?", isGreater)
print("Is your number less than 10?", isLess) 
print("Is your number equal to 10?", isEqual)
```

## Relection
The biggest challenge for me this week was staying on task, as a result, I fell behind schedule for my goals. This also serves as a calling to step up my game, catch up, and keep up with my goals. Overall it has been a great learning experience. I am beginning to see the importance of organization in both CAD and Python. Being able to keep track of what work is where and being able to quickly edit when needed is a crucial aspect for a successful project. I aim to keep quickly honing my abilities to better equip myself with the necessary skills for the tasks to come.
