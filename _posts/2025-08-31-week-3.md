excerpt: "Week 3: Practiced advanced Fusion 360 modeling and completed my first Python course, building a strong foundation in CAD workflows and programming concepts for aerospace engineering."
---

## Introduction
This week I split my focus between **Fusion 360 projects** and the **completion of my Python basics course**.  
In Fusion 360, I applied more advanced surface and solid modeling techniques, used reference geometry, and experimented with custom orientations to enhance design flexibility.  
In Python, I wrapped up my first course by working with control flow statements, functions, error handling, and object-oriented programming, all of which are crucial for creating reliable, scalable programs.  

Together, these skills continue to prepare me for my **aerospace engineering journey**, giving me both the CAD modeling expertise and programming problem-solving ability necessary for real-world engineering challenges.

## Fusion 360 — skills & deliverables
**Time invested:** ~3 hours  
**Models completed (3):** Light Bulb, Phone Case, Dog Bowl  

**Core skills practiced**
- Using spheres, threads, and cylinders to create detailed geometry  
- Sweeping profiles around complex shapes and working with imported 3D models  
- Offsetting and thickening surfaces to convert surfaces into solids  
- Customizing workspace orientation for more efficient modeling  
- Applying visual appearances and reference lines for accuracy  

**Outcomes & evidence**
- Learned to combine multiple advanced tools to create realistic models.  
- Applied joint features and external models (GrabCAD) to practice assembly-like tasks.  
- Built confidence in offsetting and thickening surfaces, expanding modeling flexibility.

## Python — skills & deliverables
**Time invested:** ~4 hours  
**Scripts created:** 13 practice programs  

**Concepts practiced**
- **Control flow statements** — running code under specific conditions and loops  
- **Functions** — writing reusable code blocks for repeated tasks  
- **Exception handling** — anticipating and dealing with runtime errors  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** — building classes, objects, attributes, methods, and encapsulation  

**Example**
```python
##Basic class with Attributes, Methods, and Encapsulation

class BankAccount:
    ##private attribute with initial balance of 0
    def __init__ (self):
        self.__balance = 0

    ##method to deposit money
    def deposit (self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount
    
    ##method to withdraw money
    def withdraw (self, amount):
        if amount <= self.__balance:
            self.__balance -= amount
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds")

    ##method to get current balance
    def getBalance (self):
        return self.__balance

##creating an instance of BankAccount  
account = BankAccount()

##depositing and withdrawing money with error handling

valid1 = False

while not valid1:
    try:
        depositAmount = float(input("Enter amount to deposit: "))
        account.deposit(depositAmount)
        print("Current balance is:", account.getBalance())
        valid1 = True
    except ValueError:
        print("Error: Invalid input, please enter numeric values.")

valid2 = False

while not valid2:
    try:
        withdrawAmount = float(input("Enter amount to withdraw: "))
        account.withdraw(withdrawAmount)
        print("Current balance is:", account.getBalance())
        valid2 = True
    except ValueError:
        print("Error: Invalid input, please enter numeric values.")
```

## Reflection

This weeks focus has been primarily on completing my python basics. I plan to continue my studies primairly in Matlabs, understaning important concepts in data analysis. I enjoyed the week and continued to grasp the importance of diversifing my knowledge in various concepts, while also learning to put them together to tackle a problem. Overall, I look forward to the weeks ahead as I continue in my studies and start to introduce physical material to my work.
