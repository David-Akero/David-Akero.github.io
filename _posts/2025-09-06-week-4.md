## Introduction
This week has primariliy been spent gettinga djust to school, therefore not much work was done. I am now in the beginner stages of project planning, while simultaneously trying to finish the rest of my Fusion360 course. I plan to start a project centered around basic concepts of model rocketry with the goal of learning how to build a rocket, what must be taken into account, and what data can be collected through this model.

I look forward to the journey ahead.
