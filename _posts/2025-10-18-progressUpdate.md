## Introduction
This is another update on where I am currently at in my aerospace journey. I am hoping to kickstart a couple projects in relation to aerospace, particularly astronautical engineering. The goal is to develop hands on, practical, and creative experiences as I learn simple aerospace and engineeirng concepts. Below is a summary of some mini projects, along with a capstone project. Further more, university applications have started, so lots of time will be spent on school work as well, meaning longer periods between blog posts. I will do my best to remain consistent!

**Spacecraft Orientation & Sensor Logger - Mini Project:** This project will focus on building a motion and orientation tracking system using a Microcontroller and an accelerometer/gyroscope. The goal is to simulate how a satellite measures and maintains its orientation in space. This will explore concepts like attitude control, sensor calibration, feedback loops, and data logging, learning how real space crafts use sensors to stay stable. This project will involve writing code to read and process sensor data, and interpreting it to understand motion dynamics concepts.

**Orbital & Trajectory Simulator - Mini Project:** This project involves creating a Python simulation to model spacecraft trajectories, orbital paths, and flight dynamics. This includes analyzing forces such as gravity, thrust, and drag, calculating how they influence motion over time. The simulator will give hands-on experience with orbital mechanics, trajectory modelling and physics-based programming, helping to understand the planning and testing involved in space missions before building physical systems.

**Rocket Stability & Airfoil Study - Mini Project:** This project involves the 3D or craft design of rocket fins and nose cones, testing how different shapes affect stability, drag, and aerospace performance. This project emphasizes iterative design, where each prototype is tested, refined, and optimized. This will allow for a deeper understanding of aerodynamics, lift, drag, and structural design.

**Rover Simulator - Capstone Project:** This project involves the building of a small, Arduino-controlled rover designed to explore and log its environment, inspired by real space exploration rovers. The rover will be able to move both manually and remotely while performing simple obstacle detection. It will collect and display sensor data such as tilt, orientation, and distance. The rover will allow experimentation with mechanical design, programming, electronics, and data logging, providing a hands-on introduction to astronautical engineering concepts. This project is designed to be expandable, with the potential to add more sensors, autonomous control, and outdoor exploration capabilities.

I will keep everyone posted! 
Thank you.
