# Week 1 â€“ Fusion 360 Beginner Projects

This week marks the start of my journey in **CAD design** using **Fusion 360**. I focused on short, hands-on projects to practice core design techniques, aiming to develop skills applicable to **aerospace engineering**.

## Projects Completed

1. **LEGO Block**  
2. **Glass Bottle** (with reference imaging)  
3. **Complex Bottle** (focus on lofting and guide rails)  
4. **Paper Clip**  
5. **Ice Tray**

## Key Skills Practiced

- 2D sketches, constraints, and construction lines  
- Extrude, revolve, hollowing, and cutting material  
- Loft, sweep, fit-point splines, and guide rails  
- Rectangular patterns and tangent arcs  
- Offset and midplane construction planes; intersecting geometry  
- Filleting and applying appearances  
- Reference imaging for accurate modeling  
- Turning sketches into construction lines

## Notes / Highlights

- Familiarizing myself with each feature was difficult at first, but slowly became more natural.
- My favourite feauture so far is the fit-point spline feauture becasue of its versatility. 
- Reference imaging was particularly helpful for modeling the glass bottle accurately.  
- These projects reinforce design fundamentals and prepare for more complex aerospace-focused models.
