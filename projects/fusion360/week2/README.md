# Week 2 â€“ Fusion 360 Intermediate Features

This week I built on my foundation by practicing **intermediate Fusion 360 design tools** through hands-on practice building a variety of models. I learned more of the various features available in Fusion360, and a better understanding of how to apply them in complex designs.

---

## Projects Completed
- Fusion 360 models using polygons, mirroring, and advanced fillets  
- Custom hole features and chamfers (tool + revolved)  
- Embossed/debossed text for labels and decoration  
- Combined multi-body designs with selective appearances  
- Python scripts practicing arithmetic, conditional, and string operators  

---

## Key Skills Practiced
- Polygon & mirror sketching for balanced designs  
- Chamfers and hole features (standard + custom)  
- Parametric edits & fixing errors through the timeline  
- Text, emboss/deboss for modeling labels  
- Combining multiple bodies & applying selective materials  
- Complex fillet variations (offset, multiple layers)  
- Organized workflow with named sketches and managed parametric timeline  
- Arithmetic & conditional operators for calculations and logic in Python  
- String operators for text joining and manipulation

## Notes / Highlights
- Gained confidence working with **parametric revisions** and solving small errors in Fusion.  
- Adding materials and finishes to specific regions made designs look more realistic.  
- Time spent: ~2 hours Fusion
