# Week 3 â€“ Fusion 360 Projects  

This week I continued my journey in **CAD design** using **Fusion 360**. I focused on applying more advanced surface and solid modeling techniques, integrating reference geometry, and experimenting with custom orientations, aiming to apply them to **aerospace-related designs**.

## Projects Completed  
1. **Light Bulb**
2. **Phone Case**
3. **Dog Bowl**

---

## Key Skills Practiced  
- Using spheres, threads, and cylinders to create detailed geometry  
- Sweeping profiles around complex shapes and working with imported 3D models  
- Offsetting and thickening surfaces to convert surfaces into solids  
- Customizing workspace orientation for more efficient modeling  
- Applying visual appearances and reference lines for accuracy  

---

## Notes / Highlights  
- Reference and intersecting lines helped keep proportions accurate while modeling the light bulb.  
- My favourite feature this week was the **sweep tool**, especially when used for the phone case project.  
- Importing models and learning joints gave me a sense of how assemblies might be handled in aerospace design.  
- Surface-to-solid techniques opened up more flexibility for future engineering applications.
