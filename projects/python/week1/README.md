# Week 1 – Python Foundations

This week marks the start of my journey in **Python programming**. I focused on **basic syntax** and **core data structures** through small, hands-on scripts. These projects are building blocks for more advanced programming applicable to **aerospace engineering**.

## Projects Completed / Scripts

1. **Age Calculator** – Calculates user age based on birth year  
2. **Custom Greeting** – Prints personalized greetings  
3. **Distance Converter** – Converts kilometers to miles  
4. **Max & Min Values in a List** – Finds maximum and minimum numbers  
5. **Count Occurrences in a Tuple** – Counts how many times a value appears  
6. **Dictionary Management** – Adds and removes student entries  
7. **Set Operations** – Demonstrates union, intersection, and difference

---

## Key Skills Practiced

- Python syntax: input/output, type conversion  
- Data structures: lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries  
- Built-in functions: `max()`, `min()`, `count()`  
- Set operations: union (`|`), intersection (`&`), difference (`-`)  
- Writing, testing, and debugging small scripts  
- Organizing code logically for readability

## Notes / Highlights

- Practicing with hands-on scripts helped solidify understanding of data types and operations.  
- Learning set operations and dictionaries prepares me for handling more complex data in aerospace applications.  
- Documentation and comments in scripts help maintain clarity and future usability.
