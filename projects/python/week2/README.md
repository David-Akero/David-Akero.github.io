# Week 2 – Python Operators Practice

This week I explored how **operators** work in Python, focusing on their role in performing calculations, comparisons, and string manipulation. These exercises helped build a stronger foundation for writing functional code.

---

## Concepts Practiced
- **Arithmetic operators** – performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations.  
- **Conditional (comparison) operators** – checking equality, inequality, and greater/less-than conditions.  
- **String operators** – combining and repeating text using concatenation and repetition.  

---

## Key Skills Learned
- Using Python to handle basic math problems with arithmetic operators.  
- Writing conditional expressions to guide program logic.  
- Manipulating text with string operators to format and build outputs.  
- Understanding the difference between **numerical operations** and **word/text operations** in Python.  

---

## Notes / Highlights
- Practicing with operators gave me a clearer sense of **how code evaluates expressions**.  
- Learned how combining operators allows more complex logic and calculations.  
- Time spent: ~1 hour focused coding practice.
