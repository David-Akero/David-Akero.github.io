# Week 3 – Completion of Python Basics Course

This week I focused on **control flow statements**, **functions**, **exception handling**, and lastly **object-oriented prgramming** through practical, hands-on scripts. These projects marked the completion of my first python course, helping me build a solid understanding of the language and better prepare myself for the various projects to come. 

---

## Projects Completed / Scripts
1. **Largest Number** – Determines the largest of three numbers given by the user using using conditional statements
2. **Even Number Printing** – Prints out all even numbers from 1 to 20 using a for loop and conditional statements.
3. **Number Range (1-50)** – Checks if an inputed number is within the range of 1 and 50 using conditional statments.
4. **Multiple of 7** - Goes through a list and finds the first instance of a multiple of 7 using a for loop and break to exit the loop.
5. **Print (10-1)** - Using the while loop and not operation, prints out numbers 10 to 1.
6. **Sum Function** - Created a function that takes 2 numbers and finds the sum.
7. **isEven Function** - Function that determines whether a given number is odd or even.
8. **Greet Function** - Function that defaults the users name to "Guest", and prints out a greeting. The program also prompts the user for a name that can be passed through the function.
9. **Factorial Function** - Function that determines the factorial of a given non-negative number.
10. **ZeroDivisionError Handling** - A program that divides two given numbers, and also handles the invalid operation of dividing by zero.
11. **ZeroDivisionError & ValueError Handling** -  A program that divides two given numbers while handling invalid inputs such as dividing by zero or non-numerical values.
12. **Using Finally** - A program that prompts for number, handles non-numeric inputs, and alerts the user they have completed the program using finally.
13. **Bank Account** - Created a class with basic attributes, methods, and encapsulation. It is a bank account that prompts the user to deposit an amount of money, and withdraw, checking if there are sufficient funds for withdrawl. This program also handles non-numeric input.

## Key Skills Practiced
- How to manipulate certain code in terms of how often it should run, and under what circumstances (**control flow statements**).
- How to create reusabe code blocks to perfomr specific, repetive tasks (**functions**).
- How to smoothly deal with certain errors that may occur while running code (**Excpetion handling**).
- The basics of Object Oriented Programming -- creating classes, objects, attributes, methods, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation (**OOP in Python**).

## Notes / Highlights
- Time Spent: ~4 hours focused coding practice
- Each skill work well together to both complete given tasks efficiently, and handle potential errors along the well. I learned this as I continued through the course, seeing how each skill slowly built on each other, eventually working together to make one efficient program.
- I particularly enjoyed error handling. It allows me to anticipate potential erros that could occur while running the program -- input erros, value errors, etc --- and deal with them efficiently.
- These lessons help build my understanding of real-world application, particularly **OOP** which helps in realistic visualization.
